These services, which start in Ops 201 and continue after Ops 401 graduation, involve a series of events, workshops, and assignments that help you think holistically about your new career and take actionable steps towards success.\nLearn More\n\nMaterial Requirements\nFor all Ops courses beyond 101, you must come to class on the first day with:\n\nA recent-model laptop (or desktop) computer\nAn Ops Lab Kit from Code Fellows, which contains tools of an IT pro, and a PC to use for labs (where you can uninstall/reinstall the operating system repeatedly).\n\nLaptop Requirements\nYou are required to supply your own laptop that meets the below requirements. Chromebooks are not suitable for this course, since they are generally underpowered, and not configured for you to control the installed software. You are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your laptop throughout the course.\n\n64-bit Operating System, like macOS or Windows 10\nFully up to date, with the latest version of the operating system and all security updates installed\nAt least 100GB of free space on the hard drive\nAt least 16GB of RAM required. 32GB RAM strongly preferred\nFree of viruses, and in general working order\n\nOps Lab Kit\nBy the first day of class, you will need to have received an Ops Lab Kit from Code Fellows. This means you are responsible for picking up the Lab Kit at a published time or arranging for it to be delivered to you before class starts.\nEach kit contains:\n\nA desktop tower PC computer intended for lab and data overwrite\nCompatible peripherals\nTwo 32GB USB 3.0 flash drive\nSysadmin toolkits\nCat5e networking supplies\nA wireless router for firmware modifications\nAnd more!\n\nEach kit costs $400, which will be billed to you with your course invoice.\n\nStacked Modules\nConcepts in each of our courses are taught using stacked modules, where a new concept is introduced in each class session, building upon what came before it. This is a challenging style that requires persistence, practice, and collaboration, but allows more concepts to be introduced over the length of the course. This method helps students learn and retain more information in a short period of time.
