The Nights & Weekends track may be part-time, but it\u2019s still intensive! Come to campus weeknights for 2 weeks and on one Saturday for the exact same in-depth curriculum offered in the Daytime Immersive.

Build your own schedule to complete the same curriculum in our self-paced online option. Access lecture videos from the Daytime Immersive, join a chat channel dedicated to you and your peers, and schedule screen-share sessions with an instructor to help you get unstuck.

These services, which start in Code 201 and continue after Code 401 graduation, involve a series of events, workshops, and assignments that help you think holistically about your new career and take actionable steps towards success. Learn More\u00a0\u00bb\n\nMaterial Requirements\nYou are required to supply your own laptop that meets the below requirements. Chromebooks are not suitable for this course, since you can\u2019t directly control installed software. Most students use Macs. You are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your computer throughout the course. The course pre-work will have specific instructions for configuring your computer to be ready for the first day of class.\n\n64-bit Operating System, like macOS, Ubuntu or Windows 10 Pro.\nFully up to date, with the latest version of the operating system and all security updates installed.\nAt least 50GB of free space on the hard drive.\nAt least 8GB of RAM. 16GB RAM strongly preferred.\nFree of viruses, and in general working order.\n\nBy the first day of class, you will need:\n\nThe latest version of Google Chrome\nThe Visual Studio Code editor\nA GitHub account\nYou will also need the  Web Design with HTML & CSS, JavaScript & jQuery book set by Jon Duckett\n\n\nStacked Modules\nConcepts in each of our courses are taught using stacked modules, where a new concept is introduced in each class session, building upon what came before it. This is a challenging style that requires persistence, practice, and collaboration, but allows more concepts to be introduced over the length of the course. This method helps students learn and retain more information in a short period of time. Learn more about stacked modules \u00bb\n\nHomework Policy\nIn order to pass the class, students must attain at least 90% of available points.\n\nProfessionalism\nPunctuality, participation in discussions, completion of assignments, and demonstration of professional courtesy to others are required, in accordance with our Code of Conduct. Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class. Passing requires at least 90% attendance. Students should always contact the instructors ahead of time if they are unable to attend all or part of the published class/lab hours.\nApply Now"
